  Exercises to complete this week:
  Exercise 2.1.1 - Style all of the h1 elements in your HTML blue.

  Exercise 2.2.1 - Change the font of your page to Arial. 
  Exercise 2.2.2 - Think of a primary and a secondary colour that compliment each 
                   other for your website. Now colour all of your anchor elements 
                   in your primary colour, and remove the default underline by using the 
                   text-decoration property.

  Exercise 2.3.1 - Add a class called primaryBackground to your nav and footer elements, 
                   and set the background colour of these to your primary colour. 
                   If your primary colour is dark, change your font colour to a lighter 
                   colour inside these classes, or vice versa.                 
  Exercise 2.3.2 - In your navigation list of three items, add an ID to the li element 
                   of the page that you’re currently on and call it active. Style this 
                   ID specifically to highlight that you’re on this page in your navigation 
                   by using a border or text-decoration property.

  Exercise 2.4.1 - On your h2 element, add a new class, then use that class selector to set it 
                   to a specific colour. Now add another class to that same element and 
                   give it a different colour, what happens?
  Exercise 2.4.2 - Now also give the same h2 an ID, and give it a completely different colour. What happens?
                  
  Exercise 2.5.1 - Set the page font size to be 16 pixels. Now change all font sizing 
                   for your h1, h2, and p elements to use rem. 
  Exercise 2.5.2 - Now do the same with your navigation items and your footer. 
                   Get them to a size that you like, using rem.
